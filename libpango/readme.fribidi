This directory holds a stripped down version of GNU FriBidi
library. The fribidi version that fribidi.patch is against was
obtained with "cvs up -D '2003-07-14'" from the fribidi cvs repository.

00:18:24 < behdad> please write somewhere in bold huge red font that
                   you have grabbed fribidi from CVS dated X, with
                   fribidi_env patch, and you dropped env stuff
                   yourself.

Like Pango, FriBidi is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public License - see the file COPYING in the toplevel
directory of the Pango distribution.

The fribidi_tab_char_type_2.i table was updated to that of FriBidi 0.10.5
which corresponds to Unicode 4.1.

From the README of Fribidi:


This is is FriBidi, a Free Implementation of the Unicode BiDi algorithm.

Background
==========
One of the missing links stopping the penetration of free software in
Israel is the lack of support for Hebrew. In order to have proper
Hebrew support, the BiDi algorithm must be implemented. It is my hope
that this library will stimulate more Hebrew free software.

Of course the BiDi algorithm is not limited to Hebrew, so I expect 
that our Arab neighbors will also find this software useful.

Audience
========

It is my hope that this library will stimulate the implementation of
Hebrew and Arabic in lots of free software. Here is a small list of
projects that would benifit from the use of the FriBidi library, but
of course there are many more: Wine, Mozilla, Gtk, Gnome, Qt, KDE,
AbiWord, lynx.
