Check INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.
Report bugs to https://bugs.freedesktop.org in the fontconfig module.

2.3.93

Create cache files in /var/cache/fontconfig with hashed filenames, if
possible, for added FHS compliance.  
Make fc-cat read both per-directory and global cache files.  
Add config file for Persian fonts from Sharif FarsiWeb, Inc.  
Major performance improvements by Dirk Mueller, Stephen Kulow, and Michael Matz at SuSE: in particular, speed up FcFontSetMatch, and inline many functions.
Fix treatment of globs in config files, broken since 2.3.2 and discovered by Mathias Clasen.
Don't use freetype internal headers (patch by Matthias Clasen).  
Further space improvements: create langsets statically, so that they can live in .rodata.
Properly align mmapped data structures to make e.g. ia64 happy.  
Bug fixes.

2.3.92

Fix corrupted caches bugs from 2.3.91 (reported by Mike Fabian).
Store only basename in the cache, reconstitute on demand 
(reported by James Cloos).
Change the rule for artificial emboldening in fonts.conf.in.  This
enables the support for artificial emboldening included in cairo
(patch by Zhe Su).
Add FC_EMBEDDED_BITMAP object type to tell Xft/Cairo whether
to load embedded bitmaps or not (patch by Jinghua Luo).
Fix GCC4 warnings (some by Behdad Esfahbod).
Support localized font family and style names; this has been reported
to break old apps like xfd, but modern (gtk+/qt/mozilla) apps work
fine (patch by Zhe Su).
Prevent fc-list from escaping strings when printing them (reported by
Matthias Clasen).
Add valist sentinel markup for FcObjectSetBuild and 
FcPatternBuild (patch by Marcus Meissner).
Add consts to variables so as to move arrays into .rodata (patch by
Ross Burton).
Modify config file to use Greek fonts before Asian fonts with
Greek glyphs. (patch by Simos Xenitellis).
Use libtool -no-undefined flag on all platforms (patch by Christian
Biesinger).

2.3.91

Use libxml2 if requested or if expat not available. (Mathias Hasselmann)
Fix multi-arch cache files: compute the position for the
block to be added using info from OrigFile, not NewFile. (plam)
Cast results of sizeof() to unsigned int to get rid of
warnings on x86_64 (reported by Matthias Clasen).
Use FcAtomic to rewrite cache files; don't unlink the fonts.cache-2
file even if there's no data to write; just write an empty cache file.
(Reported by Lubos Lunak)
Allocate room for the subdirectory names in each directory cache. 
(Reported by James Cloos)

2.3.90

Development release of mmap patch: load pattern information
directly from cache files.  (Patrick Lam)

2.3.2

Patch memory leaks in using iconv.  (Reported by Chris Capoccia)
Patch memory leaks in fc-cache. (Reported by Chris Capoccia)
Fetch bitmap glyphs to get widths during font evaluation. (keithp)
Share strings through FcObjectStaticName (Ross Burton)
Windows build updates (Tor Lillqvist)

2.3.1

Be more careful about broken GSUB/GPOS tables (Manish Singh)
Include debian packaging stuff in CVS (Josselin Mouette)
Add more conf.d examples (Keith Packard)
Make manuals build again (Keith Packard)
Johap -> Johab (Funda Wang)

2.3.0

Fix memory leak of patterns rejected by configuration (#2518)

Create prototype /etc/fonts/conf.d directory and populate it with a few
sample files.  These samples are unused as the file names don't start with
numbers.

Update documentation.

2.2.99

Verify cache for FC_FILE and FC_FAMILY in every entry (#2219)

Update blanks list from recent Unicode docs (#86)

Various small build fixes (#280, #2278, 

Documentation fixes (#2085, #2284, #2285)

Add polite typechecking to config file loader (#229)

2.2.98

Share object name strings (Michael Meeks)

Eliminate a couple of codepoints from Russian orthography (John Thacker)

Add synthetic emboldening configuration changes (Jakub Pavelek)

Change FcFontSetSort to ignore language after fonts with the requested
languages have been found. (Owen Taylor)

Add some RedHat font configuration changes (Owen Tayler).

Add full Unicode case folding support to case-ignoring string functions
(Keith Packard)

Remove Han characters from Korean orthography (Tor Andersson)

2.2.97

Fc-cache sleeps before exiting to ensure filesystem timestamps are well
ordered.

Added Punjai orthography.

The timestamp in fonts.conf is gone now.  Too many problems.

The default font path includes all of the X fonts; use selectfont/rejectfont
to eliminate bitmaps, as shown in the sample local.conf file.

<include> configuration elements may now reference a directory.  Files
in that directory matching [0-9]* are loaded in UTF-8 collating sequence order.

<selectfont> configuration added to control which fonts are used.

fontformat font pattern elements built from the FT_Get_X11_Font_Format
function in newer versions of FreeType.

'capability' list constructed from gsub/gpos and silf values in TrueType
files.

Multi-lingual names (style, family, fullname) extracted and stored with
parallel <foo>lang properties marking language.

2.2.96

Fix FcConfigUpToDate to actually check all font directories and eliminate
a typo which completely prevented it from working (Lubos Lunak
<l.lunak@suse.cz>)

Remove comma at end of FcResult enum definition for picky compilers.

2.2.95

Add FcResultOutOfMemory so FcFontSetMatch can return accurate error.

Replace MIN/MAX/ABS macros which happened to be in old FreeType releases
with FC_MIN/FC_MAX/FC_ABS macros owned by fontconfig.

2.2.94

The 2.2.93 release was prepared with a broken libtool which created
the shared library without the '.so' in the file names.

2.2.93

This is the third prerelease of fontconfig 2.3.  Significant changes from
2.2.92 are:

 o	Use new FreeType #include syntax
 o	use y_ppem field instead of 'height' in bitmap sizes rec -
 	FreeType changed the semantics.  Still uses height for
	older versions of FreeType
 o	Don't construct program manuals unless docbook is available

2.2.92

 o	make distcheck work

2.2.91

 o	Switch to SGML manuals
 o	Add FC_DUAL width spacing value
 o	Add FcFini to close out fontconfig and release all memory
 
2.2

This is the third public release of fontconfig, a font configuration and
customization library.  Fontconfig is designed to locate fonts within the
system and select them according to requirements specified by applications.

Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a particular
rasterization library on the application.  The X-specific library
'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and rasterize fonts.
